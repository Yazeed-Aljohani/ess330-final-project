**Yazeed Aljohani** – **Proposal 1: Land Use Change and Carbon Emissions in the United States**

Changes in land use, such as deforestation, urban expansion, and agriculture, are significant drivers of carbon emissions. While fossil fuels dominate global CO₂ emissions, land use changes contribute around 18 percent of global emissions (Le Quéré et al., 2018). In the U.S., cropland and urban expansion reduce the carbon sequestration capacity of forests and grasslands, exacerbating climate change. Mapping and quantifying these changes over time helps understand the trade-offs between development and carbon storage. Previous studies highlight the importance of long-term land monitoring and its link to emissions using remote sensing and modeling approaches (Houghton & Nassikas, 2017).

**Objective:** To assess how changes in land use from 2001 to 2021 have impacted carbon emissions across U.S. counties. Hypothesis: Counties with the greatest loss of forest cover will exhibit the highest net increases in carbon emissions over time.

**Proposed Methods**

We will integrate two key datasets:

Land use data from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD)

Carbon flux data from NASA’s ORNL DAAC FLUXNET or the Global Carbon Project

We will map land cover change over time and use linear regression to model the relationship between forest loss and net carbon flux.

**Expected Outcomes**

We expect to find a strong correlation between forest loss and increased net carbon emissions, especially in counties with high urban or agricultural expansion. This would reinforce the need to protect natural land cover for climate mitigation.

**Yazeed Aljohani** – **Proposal 2: Comparing Transportation Emissions Before and After COVID-19 Lockdowns in Major U.S. Cities**

During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels dropped by about 7.8 percent. This was mainly because people traveled less and many activities stopped. Road transportation emissions fell by around 15.5 percent, and aviation declined by nearly 29 percent. These changes were seen around the world, including in China, Europe, and the United States (Liu et al., 2020). This natural experiment offers a unique opportunity to evaluate how reduced human activity affects urban carbon footprints. Understanding these impacts helps design low-carbon mobility solutions and inform policy for sustainable recovery (Forster et al., 2020).

**Objective:** To compare transportation-related carbon emissions in five major U.S. cities before, during, and after COVID-19 lockdowns (2019–2022).\
**Hypothesis:** Cities with stronger lockdown measures and higher public transit reliance will show the greatest emission reductions.

**Proposed Methods**

We’ll combine:

1.  **EPA’s National Emissions Inventory (NEI)** for transportation-related CO₂

2.  **Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports** or city-specific traffic datasets

We will calculate and visualize trends across time and perform ANOVA to compare emissions across periods. Tools: R (tidyverse, ggplot2), Quarto.

**Expected Outcomes**

We expect a clear drop in 2020 emissions followed by partial rebounds in 2021–22. The study can reveal how behavioral shifts contribute to decarbonization and highlight the role of transit systems in shaping emissions.

**Cade Vanek** – **Proposal 3: Surface reflectivity as it relates to precipitation levels** 

This research project will set out to map and examine the relationship between precipitation levels and albedo in a given area. This is an important topic, as predicting rainfall is an extremely valuable field for examining ecosystems, as well as for growing crops and agriculture. Cities are being built with their albedo in mind, and while the relation between heat and albedo is well-known, I would like to examine how albedo impacts patterns of rainfall. This could be a consideration for city planning and deforestation operations, as it would be very useful to know if increasing or decreasing the local surface albedo would have any impacts on the surrounding levels of rainfall. 

**Objective/hypothesis:** 

The objective of this research is to determine the role that albedo plays when it comes to precipitation levels. My hypothesis is that areas that reflect less light would have more precipitation, as there would be more heat. Examining this from a geospatial lens would allow us to get a clear picture of any correlations. 

**Expected outcomes:** 

I would expect to find rainfall correlating to low reflectance. This knowledge would be important for things like ecosystem management and city planning, as albedo of the surface is a big consideration for how a given location interacts with climate/weather.

**Cade Vanek** – **Proposal 4: Insect populations compared to CO2 emissions over time**

This research project aims to uncover the effect of increasing CO2 emissions on the decreasing population of insects around the US. Insects are a very important ecological indicator, so my goal for this proposal would be to examine the populations of insects over time, and see how they have shifted and moved in relation to CO2 emission from surrounding human development. The research is important, because insects have a huge variety of ecological niches that provide different services to the ecosystem. If we can determine how they are moving in response to our emissions, we can predict where they will be in the future, as well as hopefully determine if we can reduce emissions to help their falling populations. 

**Objective/hypothesis:** 

The objective of this experiment is to determine how insect populations have moved over time in response to CO2. The goal is to create a map of the data that can be examined through different years, so we can look for patterns in movement over time. 

**Expected outcomes:** 

I would expect to find that insects have been slowly pushed out of areas that emit considerable levels of CO2. These areas tend to be more industrialized, which pushes out native habitats as well as lowers the air quality.
