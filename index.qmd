**Yazeed Aljohani – Proposal 1: Land Use Change and Carbon Emissions in the United States**

Changes in land use, such as deforestation, urban expansion, and agriculture, are significant drivers of carbon emissions. While fossil fuels dominate global CO₂ emissions, land use changes contribute around 18 percent of global emissions (@le2018global). In the U.S., cropland and urban expansion reduce the carbon sequestration capacity of forests and grasslands, exacerbating climate change. Mapping and quantifying these changes over time helps understand the trade-offs between development and carbon storage. Previous studies highlight the importance of long-term land monitoring and its link to emissions using remote sensing and modeling approaches (@houghton2017global).

**Objective:** To assess how changes in land use from 2001 to 2021 have impacted carbon emissions across U.S. counties.\
**Hypothesis:** Counties with the greatest loss of forest cover will exhibit the highest net increases in carbon emissions over time.

**Proposed Methods**

We will integrate two key datasets:\
- Land use data from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD)\
- Carbon flux data from NASA’s ORNL DAAC FLUXNET or the Global Carbon Project

We will map land cover change over time and use linear regression to model the relationship between forest loss and net carbon flux.

**Expected Outcomes**

We expect to find a strong correlation between forest loss and increased net carbon emissions, especially in counties with high urban or agricultural expansion. This would reinforce the need to protect natural land cover for climate mitigation.

**Yazeed Aljohani – Proposal 2: Comparing Transportation Emissions Before and After COVID-19 Lockdowns in Major U.S. Cities**

During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels dropped by about 7.8 percent. This was mainly because people traveled less and many activities stopped. Road transportation emissions fell by around 15.5 percent, and aviation declined by nearly 29 percent. These changes were seen around the world, including in China, Europe, and the United States (@liu2020covid). This natural experiment offers a unique opportunity to evaluate how reduced human activity affects urban carbon footprints. Understanding these impacts helps design low-carbon mobility solutions and inform policy for sustainable recovery (@forster2020current).

**Objective:** To compare transportation-related carbon emissions in five major U.S. cities before, during, and after COVID-19 lockdowns (2019–2022).\
**Hypothesis:** Cities with stronger lockdown measures and higher public transit reliance will show the greatest emission reductions.

**Proposed Methods**

We’ll combine: - EPA’s National Emissions Inventory (NEI) for transportation-related CO₂\
- Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports or city-specific traffic datasets

We will calculate and visualize trends across time and perform ANOVA to compare emissions across periods. Tools: R (tidyverse, ggplot2), Quarto.

**Expected Outcomes**

We expect a clear drop in 2020 emissions followed by partial rebounds in 2021–22. The study can reveal how behavioral shifts contribute to decarbonization and highlight the role of transit systems in shaping emissions.

**Cade Vanek – Proposal 3: Surface Reflectivity as It Relates to Precipitation Levels**

This research project will map and examine the relationship between precipitation levels and surface albedo in a given area. Predicting rainfall is valuable for both ecosystems and agriculture. Cities are now being designed with albedo in mind, and while the relationship between heat and albedo is well established (@henderson1983surface), less is known about its impact on precipitation. Understanding how surface reflectivity influences rainfall could be valuable for city planning and deforestation decisions, especially if increasing or decreasing surface albedo has a noticeable effect on local precipitation levels.

**Objective/Hypothesis:**\
The objective of this research is to determine the role that albedo plays in influencing precipitation levels. My hypothesis is that areas with lower reflectance (albedo) will experience more precipitation due to increased heat absorption. A geospatial analysis will help determine if there is a clear pattern or correlation between the two variables.

**Expected Outcomes:**\
I expect to find that areas with lower albedo experience more rainfall. This finding could be useful for city planners and environmental scientists, especially when managing ecosystems or designing urban spaces. Understanding these interactions may also help predict local climate responses to land-use change and surface modification (@trenberth2003changing).

**Datasets:**\

- **MODIS/Terra Surface Reflectance**: Vermote & Wolfe (2021), NASA LP DAAC

**Cade Vanek** – **Proposal 4: Insect populations compared to CO2 emissions over time**

This research project aims to uncover the effect of increasing CO2 emissions on the decreasing population of insects around the US. Insects are a very important ecological indicator, so my goal for this proposal would be to examine the populations of insects over time, and see how they have shifted and moved in relation to CO2 emission from surrounding human development. The research is important, because insects have a huge variety of ecological niches that provide different services to the ecosystem. If we can determine how they are moving in response to our emissions, we can predict where they will be in the future, as well as hopefully determine if we can reduce emissions to help their falling populations (@didham2020interpreting).

**Objective/hypothesis:** 

The objective of this experiment is to determine how insect populations have moved over time in response to CO2. The goal is to create a map of the data that can be examined through different years, so we can look for patterns in movement over time. 

**Expected outcomes:** 

I would expect to find that insects have been slowly pushed out of areas that emit considerable levels of CO2. These areas tend to be more industrialized, which pushes out native habitats as well as lowers the air quality.

Warming temperatures in Florida May Support Jamaican Fruit Bat Range Expansion

Justification:

Warming temperatures may support the continued expansion of tropical biota into mainland Florida. For example, Fielding and Zaldivar (2023) discussed Breadfruit’s suitable range expansion with climate change, a plant with large compound fruit that is desirable to wildlife. The Jamaican Fruit Bat is a generalist species native to much of Mexico and the Caribbean. It is one of the only fruit bats found in Florida and thus far has only been recorded in the southern Florida Keys. According to Fabianek (2014), Jamaican fruit bats have been observed eating breadfruit. The Jamaican fruit bat prefers figs which along with breadfruit are in the family Moraceae (Wilson et al 2019). Other factors that support the expansion of this generalist bat species include a lack of natural barriers and warming winter temperatures, with increased precipitation, and an abundance of bat-friendly habitat such as trees and bridges. Using climate data and known geographical distributions of other species, we hope to predict if and when the Jamaican fruit bat, will follow this range expansion onto the mainland.

Research objective: Predict the geographical extent of the Jamaican Fruit Bat’s range expansion in Florida counties by 2050

Research question: What are the most important predictor variables for Jamaican Fruit Bat’s range expansion?

Hypothesis: Minimum winter temperatures, combined with abundance of vertical structure, will be the most strongly correlated predictor variables of bat habitat in linear regression analysis.

Proposed Methods:

Some predictor variables for bat habitat that we will test for include abundance of human-made structures, forest cover from the US Forest Service, Breadfruit range expansion predictions, and minimum winter temperatures. We will perform linear regression on each of these variables for current range of the species and extrapolate the best predictors to estimate range expansion under future climate conditions.

Contains climate-related variables and other general predictors of habitat suitability <https://envirem.github.io/>

North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABAT) has spatial data of current Artibeus jamaicensis distribution. <https://www.nabatmonitoring.org/bats-we-monitor/jamaican-fruit-eating-bat>

Expected Outcomes: We expect to find the strongest correlation between minimum winter temperature and current range of the bat, since this is a generalist species that thrives in a variety of conditions where it occurs and does not hibernate. With climate change lessening the likelihood of flash freezes in Florida, already-successful tropical pioneers could see increased success, with the Jamaican fruit bat as a representative candidate for future study.

Title:

Predicting Prunus americana Flowering Times at a Popular Colorado Hiking Trail

Justification:

Found across the United States, the widespread Prunus americana fuels wild animals and human foragers, growing along seeps and hillslopes in Colorado. Hewlett Gulch has an abundance of the species, providing forage to frugivorous birds (Shaw et al 2022), bears and hikers and offering a case study opportunity for how climate change will affect the phenology of this important species. In Colorado, P. americana is known to flower in May. (Fryer, 2010)\]. American plum seeds need a long stratification period of 50-160 days (Fryer, 2010). Due to its widespread appeal by wildlife such as bears (Hunter, 2000), understanding how Prunus americana’s abundance over time will change can help us infer the behavior and abundance of wildlife populations as well. P. americana is a microcosm of climate change’s effects on our landscape and is a key marker of summer. Although there has been little research on P. Ameriana’s flowering response to climate change, genetic research on P. aviana focused on chilling and heat requirements, which helps narrow down important variables for this study (Castéde et al 2014).

Research objective: Project American Plum flowering dates until 2050 using current flowering date data as well as climatic and soil factors

Research questions: Will American Plum’s flowering date models predict a statistically significant increase of more than 1 month?

What factors will be most significant for the flowering date based on our statistical tests?

Hypothesis: Plum flowering dates in Hewlett Gulch will move up in the year by at least one month as winters become warmer in the Front Range.

The most important factor for american plum flowering date will be soil moisture because it is a limiting factor in the semiarid climate of Colorado. Soil moisture predictions are a result of other predictor variables but probably play a more direct role in American plum blooming.

Proposed Methods: Briefly (short paragraph) describe how you plan to carry out your study. Specify the datasets and variables available and needed (try to provide links/citations for your datasets, or a notion of where you will get your data). Each project should integrate at least two data sources! Additionally, describe the scope of your study (e.g., spatial and temporal scale) and the statistical tests you will use to test your hypothesis. (10 points)

The datasets will try to capture the most important aspects of American plum phenology, looking at temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, flowering dates for the specific location of Hewlett Gulch. To do this, I will be using Colorado data.

Potential datasets to predict American Plum flowering time include:

Growing Degree Days <https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=2131> <https://climate.colostate.edu/gdd.html>

Winter Chill Hours (\< 7 degree c) <https://prism.oregonstate.edu/normals/> I’m not sure how to get narrow the data down to winter chill hours, but DeepSeek identified this dataset as a way for me to calculate the number of hours each winter chilled as an important factor for American Plum stratification

Spring Frost Risk in Colorado <https://climate.colostate.edu/data_access_new.html> <https://climate.colostate.edu/normals_stn_select_freeze.html>

Soil Moisture <https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/platforms/space-based-platforms/smap>

Phenology Baseline (Historical Flowering Dates) Ft Collins station <https://climate.colostate.edu/data_access_new.html>

Statistical tests will include linear regression using current and historical data on flowering times to find the most predictive variable, then using that information to predict future flowering times based on future climate predictions.

Expected Outcomes: Based on your research question, describe what you expect to find in the results and the reason such an outcome is important. (5 points)

We expect to find significant correlations to each of these factors with an R\^2 of greater than .70. The strongest correlation will probably be soil moisture or spring frost risk, since a high enough temperature for flowering is important for this species. American Plum flowering times or other phenological factors have potential as an indicator species of climate change because of its abundance over half the continent.
